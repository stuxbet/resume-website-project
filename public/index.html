              Hi. My name is Alexa Summers. I am an Assistant Professor of Video Game Development at Johnson 
              County Community College, and an adjunct in the School of Computing and Engineering
              at the University of Missouri—Kansas City. I have both my bachelor's and master's degrees in
              Computer Science, and am working towards a Graduate Certificate in College Teaching and Career Preparation 
              through the UMKC Preparing Future Faculty Program. My past research efforts involve atmospheric
              science research at Tel Aviv University in Israel, with a focus on natural disaster-predictions,
              and data science research at University of Missouri—Kansas City, with a focus on anxiety detection in dementia patients.
              My professional goals include implementing new curricula across both institutions involving 
              community-based collaborations, as well as becoming a department chair.

            <h2>Education Background</h2>
            <p2>
              I began taking college-level classes in 2014 as a Sophomore in high school at Johnson County Community College. I took courses offered on the Senate 155 Bill, which gave me the opportunity to take subjects I had an interest in, but never had the ability to engage with.
                <br><br>I graduated high school from Blue Valley Northwest, where I was heavily involved with our thespian troupe, National Honors Society, and the freshman mentorship program.

                Post-graduation, I continued taking classes at Johnson County Community College to complete my computer science pre-requisites to transfer to a four-year university.<br><br> I completed the requirements in May of 2018, and transferred to University of Missouri, Kansas City for my Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science.
                
                 I started my Master's of Science in Computer Science in Spring of 2020, which is also the semester I graduted with my Bachelor's. Alongside both of those milestones, this was the semester I became a Graduate Teaching Assistant at UMKC. After obtaining this position, I decided I wanted to further my education with a Graduate Certificate in College Teaching and Career Preparation, and enrolled in the program in August of 2020.<br><br>

                I obtained my Masters degree in Fall of 2021. <br><br>Currently, I am finishing up my Graduate Certificate, and will begin an Education Specialist Program in Digital Leadership at Fort Hays State Univiersity this fall.

            <h2>Diversity Statement</h2>
        <center>    <p2>
              Diversity is the act of acknowledging differences, while not feeling threatened by those 
differences. In the field of computer science and video game development, diversity is extremely 
important. As a female in a male-dominated industry, the path to success is in fact a challenging 
one. It is difficult to be seen when your voice is just as loud as everyone else’s, but people 
undervalue you. Females represent only 30% of the game development industry, which is up 
from 21% in 2017 (Clement, 2021). An interest in the field exists, however, the environment is 
not welcoming, and this drives females away from pursuing the career path. <br><br>
This is why it is my mission to create a positive and nurturing environment within my 
classroom. Although I have very few female students, it is important for me to pass along tips 
pertaining to confidence and being the loudest person in the room. Otherwise, we feel invisible, 
“...where an individual or group’s humanity and relevance are unacknowledged, ignored, and/or 
diminished in value or importance” (Brown, 2022). Although I teach video game programming 
and less about the industry as a whole, because I am the only female in my department, it is my 
responsibility to help my students find their confidence when surrounded by people who simply 
will not listen.  <br><br>
In the corporate world, it is difficult to express feelings without the concern of getting 
into trouble, and this is even more so when a deep-rooted and unrecognized bias exists. Not only 
does the difficulty come with being a female, but also with being young. I have been written off 
time and time again for being younger than my colleagues, despite having more up-to-date 
knowledge and experience. I have received many comments about my age, especially in terms of 
becoming a teacher-- I started teaching at the age of 21. Now that I have my master’s degree at 
23, people ask me often what I am going to do with my life. Teaching is not an acceptable 
answer since I have obtained a computer science degree and “could be doing something more 
worthy”. This is yet another reason why I wish to place an emphasis on diversity—I want my 
students to do what makes them happy. Like stated in Dare to Lead, “we fail the minute we let 
someone else define success for us” (Brown, 2019), therefore, it is my mission for my students to 
define their own successes. <br><br>
To support my stance on diversity, I have fully integrated this concept into my research, 
teaching, and service efforts. I volunteer as an instructor with Girls Who Code, where we teach 
girls from grades 3-12 how to program. In our group, we cover a wide range of topics, chosen 
based on the students’ interests, which helps expose them to different avenues. In addition to 
Girls Who Code, I am currently planning a Hack-A-Thon for the local high schools, in which I 
am including an educational component about breaking into the industry when feeling 
unwelcome, invisible, unmotivated, or simply too young. This is part of a larger research effort 
to better understand the mindsets of high school females with a desire to pursue a computer field. 
Lastly, I am expanding beyond diversifying the gender and aspects, and am working with Access 
Services to incorporate more about accessibility into all of my courses. This is extremely 
important because many developers see accessibility as a “waste time”, however, it is a shared 
right to access computers, and it is crucial to make this technology available to all. As far as I 
know, this curriculum is not currently a part of any program I teach in, and therefore, I have 
started integrating this aspect.<br><br><br>

            <h2>Teaching Philosophy</h2>

            <p2>In my classroom, students are my top priority. I believe that learning cannot happen unless students are comfortable, confident, and learning information that they have a genuine interest in. With this in mind, the mental and physical well-being of my students come first, to ensure they are at the top of their game.
            Another priority of mine is what happens after graduation. Preparing students for their future in the industry is key to a successful education, and my classes are geared towards building out portfolios, as well as providing experiences to put on resumes and talk about in job interviews. Class assignments are created with the student’s futures in mind, and evolve every semester to meet the new demands and expectations of future employers.
            Investing in my students and their abilities is my passion, and I look forward to learning with you.
