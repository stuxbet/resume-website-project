              Hi. My name is Alexa Summers. I am an Assistant Professor of Video Game Development at Johnson 
              County Community College, and an adjunct in the School of Computing and Engineering
              at the University of Missouri—Kansas City. I have both my bachelor's and master's degrees in
              Computer Science, and am working towards a Graduate Certificate in College Teaching and Career Preparation 
              through the UMKC Preparing Future Faculty Program. My past research efforts involve atmospheric
              science research at Tel Aviv University in Israel, with a focus on natural disaster-predictions,
              and data science research at University of Missouri—Kansas City, with a focus on anxiety detection in dementia patients.
              My professional goals include implementing new curricula across both institutions involving 
              community-based collaborations, as well as becoming a department chair.
