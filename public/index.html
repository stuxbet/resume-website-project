              Hi. My name is Alexa Summers. I am an Assistant Professor of Video Game Development at Johnson 
              County Community College, and an adjunct in the School of Computing and Engineering
              at the University of Missouri—Kansas City. I have both my bachelor's and master's degrees in
              Computer Science, and am working towards a Graduate Certificate in College Teaching and Career Preparation 
              through the UMKC Preparing Future Faculty Program. My past research efforts involve atmospheric
              science research at Tel Aviv University in Israel, with a focus on natural disaster-predictions,
              and data science research at University of Missouri—Kansas City, with a focus on anxiety detection in dementia patients.
              My professional goals include implementing new curricula across both institutions involving 
              community-based collaborations, as well as becoming a department chair.

            <h2>Education Background</h2>
            <p2>
              I began taking college-level classes in 2014 as a Sophomore in high school at Johnson County Community College. I took courses offered on the Senate 155 Bill, which gave me the opportunity to take subjects I had an interest in, but never had the ability to engage with.
                <br><br>I graduated high school from Blue Valley Northwest, where I was heavily involved with our thespian troupe, National Honors Society, and the freshman mentorship program.

                Post-graduation, I continued taking classes at Johnson County Community College to complete my computer science pre-requisites to transfer to a four-year university.<br><br> I completed the requirements in May of 2018, and transferred to University of Missouri, Kansas City for my Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science.
                
                 I started my Master's of Science in Computer Science in Spring of 2020, which is also the semester I graduted with my Bachelor's. Alongside both of those milestones, this was the semester I became a Graduate Teaching Assistant at UMKC. After obtaining this position, I decided I wanted to further my education with a Graduate Certificate in College Teaching and Career Preparation, and enrolled in the program in August of 2020.<br><br>

                I obtained my Masters degree in Fall of 2021. <br><br>Currently, I am finishing up my Graduate Certificate, and will begin an Education Specialist Program in Digital Leadership at Fort Hays State Univiersity this fall.
