              I am Luke Malcom, I am rust developer building a 3d printer control system using a game engine. I work for vertex.io and 
              build the control application for raven space systems. As a computer science student at the University of Missouri, Kansas City,
              I am on track to graduate in May 2026. My previous experience spans diverse roles, including a researcher at the Missouri Institute for Defense and Energy, 
              where I developed AFSIM plugins and optimized algorithms in C#. At Gail's Powersports, I led SEO efforts, 
              significantly increasing traffic and managing online content. My role as an assistant manager at Valvoline honed my leadership and management skills. 
              Proficient in Rust, Python, C++, and C#, I am adept with GitHub and Unity, and I possess strong capabilities in sales and marketing.

            <h2>Education Background</h2>
            <p2>
              I began taking college-level classes in 2014 as a Sophomore in high school at Johnson County Community College. I took courses offered on the Senate 155 Bill, which gave me the opportunity to take subjects I had an interest in, but never had the ability to engage with.
                <br><br>I graduated high school from Blue Valley Northwest, where I was heavily involved with our thespian troupe, National Honors Society, and the freshman mentorship program.

                Post-graduation, I continued taking classes at Johnson County Community College to complete my computer science pre-requisites to transfer to a four-year university.<br><br> I completed the requirements in May of 2018, and transferred to University of Missouri, Kansas City for my Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science.
                
                 I started my Master's of Science in Computer Science in Spring of 2020, which is also the semester I graduted with my Bachelor's. Alongside both of those milestones, this was the semester I became a Graduate Teaching Assistant at UMKC. After obtaining this position, I decided I wanted to further my education with a Graduate Certificate in College Teaching and Career Preparation, and enrolled in the program in August of 2020.<br><br>

                I obtained my Masters degree in Fall of 2021, and my graduate certificate in May of 2022. <br><br>Currently, I am working on an Education Specialist degree in Digital Leadership at Fort Hays State University.

            <h2>Teaching Philosophy</h2>
<center>
            <p2>
              
              I consider teaching to be one of my greatest passions. Not only does it allow me to continue learning from those who take my classes, but I am able to shape education in a way that creates positivity, confidence, and a love for the work. Within my career, I have many goals that stretch beyond the delivery of material—these goals include catering to different styles of learning, actively engaging students coming from underrepresented demographics, and educating other educators. 
              
              <br><br>

	As a full-time professor at an institution I attended, I take pride in working alongside the instructors who made an impact on my education. Throughout my schooling, I have been exposed to many different teaching styles, and have been able to extrapolate various methods that provide the best educational experience for learners of all kinds. This includes incorporating step-by-step auditory instructions during lectures, hands-on activities, and visual aids into my classes. While some of this can be difficult in web development due to the abstract nature of the field, I take the time to check in with students to see how I can improve their learning. With each piece of feedback, I adjust my current and future classes to foster a stronger learning environment for all kinds of learners. The most widely beneficial aspect to my classes is real-world experience, which is able to satisfy the learning needs of individuals in various ways. My classes work to create simulated client interactions, which students can apply to future employment opportunities. This kind of learning was inspired by Kolb’s Experiential Theory, which follows the cycle of trying out newly learned information by having an experience, reflecting on that experience, interpreting and learning from it, and repeating the process (Konak, 2014). Learning is said to happen if and only if all of the cycle’s stages have been reached, thus, my classwork is based on encouraging the successful completion of the cycle in order to get the most out of the experience (Konak, 2014). These projects not only provide real-world applications, but gives my students something meaty for their portfolios and resumes, as well as something to reference for potential future clients. 
  
  <br><br>
	In addition to my computer science background, I obtained my Graduate Certificate in College Teaching and Career Planning. This program provided me with information about underrepresented student groups, and how to foster a positive classroom experience for those coming from diverse backgrounds. Mental health is fragile and can be destroyed with just one knock at a person’s confidence. From my coursework, I have been given a glimpse into some of the struggles certain demographics face, and the toll it can take on one's education. With the extra knowledge I have received from top instructors and lecturers, I have learned in a more specialized way how to handle a student’s mental bandwidth with care, how to educate those in need about available resources, and how to customize the classroom experience to create a more welcoming environment. Creating a nurturing classroom with this structure is inspired by Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs. This theory is based on a pyramid of needs, beginning with physiological aspects, all the way up to self-actualization aspects (Aanstoos, 2019). As we travel up the pyramid and satisfy all the lower levels, like food, water and housing, the higher levels become more attainable, which involve things we spend our lives seeking, such as confidence, belonging, self-worth, and self-awareness (Aanstoos, 2019). By creating a classroom that functions on the same structure as the Hierarchy of Needs, beginning at the base of the pyramid and working my way up, I can help foster those feelings of belonging in both the classroom and in the web development field, a sense of accomplishment, and the confidence to continue with personal growth. Especially being new to the web development department, which has a high number of non-traditional students, fostering this classroom environment is more important than ever. 
  
  <br><br>
 Lastly, I have been working to complete my Education Specialist degree in Digital Leadership, which I will graduate with in May of 2024. This program has taken a focus on evaluating classroom technology, and introducing new technology to both faculty members and students. My research for this program has been based around the feelings of Zoom for virtual learning, and the use of alternative video conferencing software to improve engagement, and create the face-to-face interactions in virtual learning that went missing at the onset of the pandemic. My capstone project has involved hosting a professional development session regarding my findings, which has sparked a new interest in not only education technology, but also the concept of andragogy in PD sessions. As Knowles (1980) found in his original theorization, adults have different motivations and methods of learning caused by the role they are currently in and past experiences, which have to be considered when teaching them. This is especially important when it comes to classroom technology, which can be quite challenging to encourage faculty with when any kind of change is involved. 
 
 <br><br>
	Whether I am teaching students, or teaching teachers, those I am educating constantly work alongside me to help create the best version of my class that I can offer. As I work towards my teaching goals of gifting learning to all, promoting positive mental health, and engaging with technology-centered professional development opportunities, I strive to make a difference in the life of those whom I am lucky enough to both teach, and learn from along the way. <br><br><br>

              <h3>Research Experience</h3>
              <p2> I have participated in three research efforts.

                In the Fall of 2023 and Spring of 2024, I worked on my capstone project for my EdS researching the pros and cons of Zoom, and how the video conferencing alternative, InSpace, compares. I hosted a professional development session for FHSU faculty to 
                discuss my findings, and collected feedback at the session to improve upon the presentation for future use.

                In Summer of 2019, I spent the summer performing atmospheric science research at Tel Aviv University. I studied atmospheric data obtained from smartphones
                around the world from 2013-2017, and extracted surface pressure, temperature, and humidity information to create mesoscale analyses. This was in an effort
                to determine if natural disasters could be predicted before they happened.  I was only on the project for a very short time, but learned a great deal pertaining to
                meteorology, geography, and data science. <br><br>

                During Spring of 2021, I worked on a data science project called IC-SAFE. The premise of this project was anxiety detection in dementia patients. These patients can
                struggle to show emotions and ask for support, and my team's effort went towards detecting emotions in order to prevent the long-term onset of depression caused by
                frequent anxiety. We identified tremor patterns between dementia patients both with and without anxiety, and researched algorithms to differentiate between standard
                tremors, amplified tremors caused by anxiety, and other basic actions, such as reading and writing. Our final paper was accepted to the 2022 Institute of Elecetrical and 
                Electronics Engineers International Conference on Communications.<br><br></p2>
                
                <h3>Future Research Plans</h3>

               <p2> My future research plans are beginning to move in a different direction by incorporating my classes. After obtaining my EdS, I have new skills to incorporate up and coming technology into my classroom to shift the environment to a more student-centered approach. In addition, I would like to start sharing my findings with other educators, by hosting professional development sessions.<br><br>
